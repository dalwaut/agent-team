# Report: self_assessment

The full self-assessment report has been output above. Key findings:  **Score: 7.5/10** (up from 6.9 at v1.2.0). The v1.2.0 top priorities (genericize prompts, create steward, create CONVENTIONS.md) were all completed. Prompt quality jumped from 5/10 to 9/10 ΓÇö zero broken prompts remain.  **The critical bottleneck is unchanged: the system has never been run end-to-end.** All 3 reports in `latest/` are manual. The agent pipeline (agents ΓåÆ reports ΓåÆ dispatcher ΓåÆ HITL) is untested.  **Top 3 new findings:** 1. `run_squad.ps1` line 228 **destructively replaces** `latest/` ΓÇö running any squad erases reports from other squads 2. `report_dispatcher` doesn't read `tasks/registry.json` (50+ tasks invisible to dispatch) 3. The tools ecosystem (Discord, Work Companion, WP Agent) has no agent coverage except email
