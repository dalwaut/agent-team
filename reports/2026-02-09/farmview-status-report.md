## Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | FarmView |
| **Location** | `D:\SD\Home\Everglades IT\IT\Projects\FarmView - webapp` |
| **Origin** | Generated by Bolt.new (AI scaffolding tool) |
| **Onboard Status** | Queued → `Obsidian/Projects/FarmView` |

## Timeline

| Created | January 7, 2025 |
| Last modified | January 7, 2025 (~8:36 PM) |
| Age | ~13 months (untouched since day one) |
| Git repo | None |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React (TypeScript) |
| Build tool | Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + PostCSS |
| State mgmt | React Context API (CropContext, TaskContext, ThemeContext) |
| Linting | ESLint |

## Database Status

No database exists. No Supabase, Firebase, Prisma, `.env` file, or any backend/persistence layer was found. The app is purely client-side — all data lives in React Context (in-memory, lost on refresh).

## Features Built (UI Only)

- **Dashboard** — Central overview page
- **Crop Management** — Add/view/edit crops (CropCard, CropDetails, CropForm)
- **Task Management** — Full task CRUD with filters and statistics
- **Calendar** — Agricultural calendar integrated with tasks
- **Weather System** — Current conditions, hourly/weekly forecasts, alerts, map, geolocation
- **Dark/Light Theme** — Toggle component

## What's Missing

| Gap | Severity |
|-----|----------|
| No database / persistence | Critical — data doesn't survive a page refresh |
| No authentication | Critical — no user accounts |
| No backend API | Critical — frontend only |
| No deployment config | High — no Vercel/Netlify/hosting setup |
| No git repo | High — no version control |
| No README or docs | Medium |
| No CI/CD | Medium |
| No image uploads | Low — crops/tasks can't have photos |
| No notifications | Low |
| No multi-user / collaboration | Low (for MVP) |

## Recommended Path Forward

1. **Initialize git** — version control first
2. **Add Supabase** — database, auth, and storage in one (fits existing stack)
3. **Wire up persistence** — replace React Context state with Supabase queries
4. **Add authentication** — Supabase Auth for user login
5. **Deploy** — Vercel or Netlify (Vite deploys trivially)
6. **Move to OPAI Projects** — bring under `Obsidian/Projects/FarmView` with diamond workflow
