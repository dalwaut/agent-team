   - Suggest 5 screenshot/demo captions that highlight key features
   - Write a "What's New" section based on recent git commits

2. CHANGELOG
   - Read recent git commits and produce a user-friendly changelog
   - Group changes by: New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes
   - Write in non-technical language suitable for end users

4. DOCUMENTATION
   - Generate a user-facing FAQ (10 questions) based on actual functionality
   - Write a "Getting Started" guide for new users
   - Identify areas where in-app help text, README sections, or inline docs are missing
   - If README.md is missing or sparse, draft a comprehensive one

5. SEO / ASO / DISCOVERABILITY
   - Suggest 20 keywords for search optimization (app store, search engine, or package registry)
   - Write a meta description for the project's web presence
   - Suggest a tagline (under 10 words)
   - Identify competitor keywords the project should target

Base all content on actual features found in the codebase. Do not invent features that don't exist. Note any features that appear incomplete and should not be marketed yet.

Format your response as valid markdown.
Do not ask for clarification.
