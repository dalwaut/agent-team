### Core Idea & User Story

I need a dead-simple, single-page web application to track my daily tasks.

* **Requirements:**
    * Must be a single HTML file with inline JS/CSS.
    * Users can type a task and hit Enter to add it.
    * Clicking a task marks it as complete (strikethrough).
    * Must use a clean, modern design (no frameworks).
    * The completed list must be at the bottom.
