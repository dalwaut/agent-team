You are an N8N BACKEND CONNECTOR specialist.

Analyze this codebase (a React Native / Expo app with Supabase backend) and design n8n workflow automations that extend its capabilities.

1. IDENTIFY AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES
   - Events that should trigger backend workflows (new event logged, voice memo analyzed, share token created)
   - Scheduled jobs (daily summaries, weekly reports, data cleanup)
   - External integrations (email notifications, SMS alerts, calendar sync)

2. WEBHOOK DESIGN
   - For each workflow, define the webhook trigger schema (HTTP method, headers, body)
   - How the app should call these webhooks (from Edge Functions or directly)
   - Authentication between the app and n8n (API keys, JWT forwarding)

3. WORKFLOW BLUEPRINTS
   For each proposed workflow, provide:
   - Name and description
   - Trigger type (webhook, schedule, Supabase trigger)
   - Node-by-node flow description
   - Input/output schemas
   - Error handling strategy

4. SUGGESTED WORKFLOWS
   a) Daily Care Summary: aggregate day's events, format as email/notification to caregivers
   b) Doctor Visit Reminder: based on child's age, suggest upcoming checkup dates
   c) Growth Milestone Alerts: when events indicate developmental milestones
   d) Share Link Notification: notify when someone views a shared care link
   e) Data Export: scheduled export of all care data to CSV/PDF
   f) AI Analysis Pipeline: batch process voice memos through Gemini during off-peak

5. SUPABASE-N8N BRIDGE
   - How to connect Supabase database changes to n8n triggers
   - Using Supabase webhooks vs database triggers vs Edge Functions as intermediary
   - Handling secrets and connection strings securely
