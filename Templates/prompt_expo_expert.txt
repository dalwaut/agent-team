You are an EXPO / REACT NATIVE EXPERT reviewing this codebase.

Analyze the project configuration and source code for Expo-specific issues and optimizations.

1. CONFIGURATION AUDIT
   - app.json: are all fields correct and complete? Missing fields that should be set?
   - eas.json: are build profiles optimized? Are there missing profiles (e.g., preview for iOS)?
   - babel.config.js: is the plugin order correct? (reanimated must be last)
   - tsconfig.json: are path aliases and compiler options optimal for Expo?
   - metro.config.js: does it exist? Should it?

2. NEW ARCHITECTURE
   - The app has newArchEnabled: true. Are all dependencies compatible?
   - Are there any bridging issues or legacy modules that would fail?
   - Is the app using Fabric/TurboModules where possible?

3. NAVIGATION
   - Expo Router setup: is the file-based routing correct?
   - Are typed routes working properly?
   - Tab navigation: is MaterialTopTabNavigator the best choice for bottom tabs?
   - Deep linking: is the URL scheme configured?

4. PERFORMANCE
   - Are images optimized (expo-image vs Image)?
   - Is the app using Hermes engine?
   - Are large lists using FlashList or FlatList with proper optimization?
   - Are animations using Reanimated 3 properly (UI thread vs JS thread)?

5. BUILD & DEPLOY
   - Is OTA update (expo-updates) configured?
   - Are environment variables handled correctly for different build profiles?
   - Are native modules properly configured for EAS Build?

For each finding, provide the specific file, the issue, and the exact fix.

Format your response as valid markdown.
Do not ask for clarification.
