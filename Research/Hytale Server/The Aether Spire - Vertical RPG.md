**Business Concept: "The Aether Spire" (Vertical RPG)** **Theme:** _Sword Art Online_ inspired, but distinct. A procedurally generated "Tower of God" aesthetic.

This is a winning concept because it solves the "content drought" problem—players always have a "next floor" to grind for.

### **1. The Mechanics: "The Spire" Economy**

Your idea to lock marketplaces by floor is brilliant for long-term player retention. It creates "mini-economies" that prevent hyper-inflation (a common killer of MMO servers).

- **The "Floor Lock" System:**
    
    - **Floors 1–10 (The Slums):** Wood/Stone gear only. Currency: "Copper Shards".
        
    - **Floors 11–20 (The Industrial District):** Iron/Steel. Currency: "Silver Obols".
        
    - **The Restriction:** A player on Floor 1 cannot even _see_ items from Floor 20 in the market. This prevents a Level 50 player from giving a "God Sword" to a Level 1 newbie (Twinking), forcing everyone to play the content legitimately.
        
- **Monetization (The 0% Fee Strategy):**
    
    - _Note:_ Hytale’s policy (Jan 2026) allows "Gameplay Affecting" purchases **only** if you tag your server as **"Teen/Mature"** (13+). If you tag it "All Ages," you can only sell cosmetics.
        
    - **Recommendation:** Tag it **"Teen"**. This allows you to sell:
        
        - **"Caravan Licenses":** Paid item allowing a player to transport _one_ high-level item down to a lower floor (rare, high value).
            
        - **Market Stalls:** Rent prime real estate in the Floor 1 hub. Players pay you real money (via store) to have their shop stand out.
