We are going to want to flesh out this agent's skills and knowledge about building Wordpress pages with fusion builder content. Our goal is to get to a point with this agent that we can have it create a page/post or any content and it be built with proper fusion builder elements ( is doing pretty well currently but could always use improvement) and designed to be beautiful, and professionally done like other example pages we present to you or simply ask for you to create. 

We can provide avada templates for example data to train on if that helps. What is the best method to accomplish this and recursively make this agent and it's skills better?"
